# Getting Started with Create React App

## Explaining index.js

The `src/index.js` file is the entry point of your React application. Here's a breakdown of its contents:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';
```
These lines are importing the necessary modules for the application. `React` and `ReactDOM` are the main libraries for building the UI. `index.css` contains global styles. `App` is the main component of your application. `reportWebVitals` is a function that can be used to measure the performance of your app.

```javascript
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```
Here, a root for your application is created on the HTML element with the id 'root'. This is typically a div element in your `public/index.html` file. The `App` component is rendered inside this root element. `React.StrictMode` is a wrapper component that checks for potential problems in the application during the development build.

```javascript
reportWebVitals();
```
This line is calling the `reportWebVitals` function. By default, it does nothing. You can provide a callback to it to measure the performance of your app, for example, `reportWebVitals(console.log)`.

In summary, `src/index.js` sets up and starts your React application by rendering the `App` component into the root div in your HTML.
